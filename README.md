## General overview: 
---
<p style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> 
In this project Andrew and I worked on building a website using a brand new framework and two new api's. Are goal was to present a user with a site that not only had meaningful data and heartbreaking news, but also comforting sights. We achieved this by supplying covid data from any state in the USA, while also supplying gif's of cats at the click of a button. For this project I mostly focused on using the new framework and building the HTML & CSS. Andrew worked on the script side and collecting api data.
